# Shor-s-Algorithm
A Qiskit implementation of Shor's algorithm. It is done for group project "Integer factorization using Shor's algorithm" for quantum algorithms course at [CMI](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). Our group comprised of Hardik Kalra, Hrishikesh Saikia and Bijayan Ray.

One can import the notebook into [IBM quantum lab](https://quantum.ibm.com/lab) otherwise on can download it and run it locally after installing qiskit through pip in order to test the code. On IBM quantum lab one can change the backend to run on appropriate quantum machines.
